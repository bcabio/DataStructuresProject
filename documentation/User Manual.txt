System Requirements
 - Platform
    - Smashr is a browser based solution, using JavaScript to communicate with the backend server. For consumer use, all that would be needed is an updated web browser and internet connection.
    - For full database implementation, this project was built for Windows machines, using Typescript and Angular 2, while using a MySQL database. See Deployment doc for more info.

 - Using Smashr
    - Navigate to localhost:5000 or an alternative hosted url, and click Start on the screen.
    - Select a character to be given detailed stats about that character, including win/loss percentage, pick rates, etc.
    - Alternatively, select a Player to view stats about the specific player, including character pick rates, win rates, etc.
